# Welcome contributors :icecream:
- This is piece of doc for those who want to contribute and make changes to our current docs
- Here you can expect to know more about pull request and how to use it to contribute to our docs

# How to submit your changes
- First you need to know what actually is a `pull request` and you can find it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
- Next, here is how to?

## :one: You need to fork this doc repo to your own place
## :two: Clone it to your local machine by a git command 
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Training-and-Documentation
```
## :three: Head to the folder you have cloned then create a branch there 
```
git branch Doc-contribution
```
## :four: To make sure that you can push to the right branch, in this case it is `Doc-contribution` because we have just opened a pull request here, you have to switch yourself to that branch
```
git checkout Doc-contribution
```
## :five: Now enjoy your changing in your local machine 
## :six: When finish `add` changes, `commit` and `push`
## :seven: Done! you are all set then inform me through `nhutnguyenf330@gmail.com` as a P.O, I will check all out and give out feedbacks
