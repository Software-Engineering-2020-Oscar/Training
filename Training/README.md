## Here we focus on training things related to our course 
* The 2 things in our course are Agile and Scrum

## Scrum steps
- You may need get things started with those steps below if you want to apply Scrum model to your project
1. Choose the product owner
  This is the person with the vision of what needs to be done. He or she inventories risks writes the stories that need to be done and checks what is feasible and what can be     done.

2. Compose your team
   Who will do the actual work? Keep your teams small (3 to 9 people).

3. Choose a scrum master
   This person guides the team and helps to remove impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.

    The scrum master is not a traditional team lead or project manager but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences.

4. Create a product backlog
    The product backlog comprises an ordered list of requirements that a scrum team maintains for a product.

    It consists of features, bug fixes, non-functional requirements, etc.—whatever needs doing in order to successfully deliver a viable product.
    The product owner orders the product backlog items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, and date needed.

5. Refine the product backlog
    Estimate how much work each issue needs. The team must check if an issue is doable. Each issue has to be showable in a demo. Plan your backlog not by estimating immediately in   hours.

    Use terms like ‘small, medium, large’ or the Fibonacci numbers (1,2,3,5,8,13,21, …) After a couple of weeks, you’ll see how many things you can do.

6. Sprint planning
    A sprint is a combination of tasks within a fixed time frame. Sprints always have a fixed time frame which varies from 1 to 4 weeks.

    The team takes a look at the items in the backlog and estimates how much can be done in one sprint.
    The number of issues that the team can execute in one sprint is called the team’s speed. One should always try to get more issues done in one sprint.

    Also important is that once you have set the items of the sprint, you don’t change that anymore. Nothing can be added! New issues are for the next sprint.

7. Make the work visible
    You can do this using a scrum board with 3 columns: ‘to do’, ‘work in progress’ and ‘done’. (in development you could also add a column ‘testing’)

8. Daily stand-up of daily scrum
    On a daily basis you organize a short meeting that will take 15 minutes tops and answer the following questions:

    What did you do yesterday to help the team accomplish this sprint?
    What are you going to do today?
    Are there any obstacles standing between you or your team and achieving the sprint goals?
  
9. Sprint demo
    At the end of every sprint, you hold a meeting with the team where you discuss what has been achieved. Each team member presents their part of what has been made or realized.

10. Sprint evaluation
    After the team has shown the progress of the sprint, you hold a meeting to discuss what has gone good, what could have been done better and what needs to be improved in the      next sprint.
